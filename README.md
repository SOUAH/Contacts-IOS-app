**Contacti**: Smart, Categorized Contact Management

**Overview:**
Contacti is a modern, native iOS application designed for streamlined contact organization. It goes beyond standard contact lists by allowing users to classify and manage their contacts within custom categories.
This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in modern iOS development architecture, including advanced data persistence and contemporary UI design principles.


**Key Features:**

* **Core CRUD Functionality:** Easily add, edit, and delete contacts within the application.

* **Categorized Lists:** Contacts are displayed in categorized sections, providing a clean, hierarchical view.

* **Custom Classification:** Users can assign contacts to predefined categories:
